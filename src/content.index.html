          <em>Escape from Uncertainty: Revelations</em>
          is the fourth major chapter of a Neverwinter Nights persistent world
          that has been running since the autumn of 2005.

          We are a role-playing and story-based server
          with extremely lofty ambitions
          for new heights of cooperative story-telling and immersive role-play.

          Using the game engine of Neverwinter Nights as our medium,
          players are responsible for consistently role-playing characters
          that participate in a fully immersive world.

          The mature and experienced DM staff is constantly working
          to improve the EfU experience
          on both a game-play level and story-level.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a community, we enthusiastically welcome new players
          who bring with them creativity, good sportsmanship, and maturity.

          Our world is technically sophisticated, professionally hosted,
          constantly updated, richly developed,
          and has a thriving and active community of players and DMs.

          By the standards of NWN, EfU is a relatively low-level,
          low magic-power world. We challenge players and their characters
          both mechanically and creatively.

        <h1>Setting Summary</h1>
        <p>
          Using the Forgotten Realms setting as our rough, general background,
          our non-canon setting has been otherwise richly developed
          over the course of several years.

          The fourth and most recent chapter primarily takes place
          in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world in which characters have fled
          a lightless and ruined surface in order to find sanctuary
          within a vast underworld.

          Characters begin as having survived somehow
          in a world in which the sun has been devoured by a primordial darkness
          and horrible aberrant armies pursue a campaign of conquest
          across the land.
