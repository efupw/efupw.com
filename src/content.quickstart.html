        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <h2>Understand</h2>
        <p>
          This is a roleplaying persistent world well suited for
          players both with an interest in intensive
          characterization and story-based conflict as well as
          considerable mechanical challenge. Average character
          level is around 7 with exceptional characters
          occasionally reaching level 10. Although there are
          rules to prevent mindless griefing, legitimate
          story-based pvp conflict is accepted and being killed
          by another character almost always represents a
          permanent end to your PC. If you're not certain you're
          a good match for our server, spend some time reviewing
          our forums or reach out to us on IRC or Discord:<br>

        <h2>Character Development</h2>
        <p>
          All kinds of Forgotten Realms character backgrounds
          and all standard classes and races can work in EfU.
          However, bear in mind that much has been changed
          from canon. The best characters for EfU are ones
          which are richly characterized, complex in their
          strengths and weaknesses, and are not built simply
          for the purposes of optimized mechanical power.

        <h2>Your Character&rsquo;s Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
          The beginning of the end was when the Red Star rose
          into the night sky, and magic stopped working in the
          way it once had. Waves of wild magic crackled across
          all of Faerun, inflicting a terrible price of
          destruction and still birth. Doom-speakers spoke with
          greater certainty of the approaching end times. Magic
          had once been kept in check by the moderating
          influence of Mystra; but with Mystrylâ€™s rebirth and a
          weave that refused to be controlled there was no
          predicting what might become possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet this catastrophe was nothing compared to the doom
          that came less than one year later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Released by distant and obscure ritual, a sinuous
          shape of blackness rose from the south, arced across
          the sky in the direction of the sun. The Night Serpent
          Dendar, grown strong on its diet of nightmares,
          engulfed the sun in its terrible maw and so was this
          ultimate life-giving source of light and warmth
          extinguished.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the Darkening, the civilisations of Faerun were
          plunged into chaos. The Night Serpent continued its
          celestial rampage, devouring many gods and destroying
          their realms. Violence, famine, murder, plague, and
          environmental collapse ruined populations. Deprived
          even of hope for divine rescue, the apocalyptic
          catastrophe resulted in near complete devastation of
          the surface world.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was then that the Illithid Empire struck. Waiting
          with cold patience, they had first succeeded at
          enthralling many races of the Underdark and fashioning
          them, along with legions of enslaved surfacers and
          other monstrous creatures, into a cyclopean host of
          twisted thralls capable of conquering all the Planes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Illithid servants roam uncontested upon the barren
          wastes of the surface. Cities are being raised to the
          majesty of their masters. Grotesque intellects gaze at
          the stars, where their counterparts plot to consume
          other worlds and stranger races.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of your kind has long since perished or been
          enslaved by the mind flayers, yet somehow you endured.
          Somehow you survived. Now you wander, alone in the
          wastes, searching.
        </p>
        <p>
          Searching&hellip; searching for what?
        </p>
