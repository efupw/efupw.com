      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>
        <em>Escape from Uncertainty: Revelations</em>
        is the fourth major chapter of a Neverwinter Nights persistent world
        that has been running since the autumn of 2005.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a role-playing and story-based server
        with extremely lofty ambitions
        for new heights of cooperative story-telling and immersive role-play.

        Using the game engine of Neverwinter Nights as our medium,
        players are responsible for consistently role-playing characters
        that participate in a fully immersive world.

        The mature and experienced DM staff is constantly working
        to improve the EfU experience on both a game-play level and story-level.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a community, we enthusiastically welcome new players
        who bring with them creativity, good sportsmanship, and maturity.

        Our world is technically sophisticated, professionally hosted,
        constantly updated, richly developed
        and has a thriving and active community of players and DMs.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the standards of NWN, EfU is a relatively low-level,
        low magic-power world. We challenge players and their characters
        both mechanically and creatively.
      </p>
      <h1>Setting Summary</h1>
      <p>
        Using the Forgotten Realms setting as our rough, general background,
        our non-canon setting has been otherwise richly developed
        over the course of several years.

        The fourth and most recent chapter primarily takes place
        in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world in which characters have fled
        a lightless and ruined surface in order to find sanctuary
        within a vast underworld.

        Characters begin as having survived somehow
        in a world in which the sun has been devoured by a primordial darkness
        and horrible aberrant armies pursue a campaign of conquest
        across the land.
